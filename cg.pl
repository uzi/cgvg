# cg - Code Grep - grep recursively through files and disiplay matches
# Copyright 1999 by Joshua Uziel <juziel@home.com> - version 1.5.2
#
# usage: cg [-i] [pattern] [files]
#
# Recursive Grep script that does a bit of extra work in adding a count
# field and storing the data in a file, as well as displaying data in a
# colorful and human-readable fashion.  Run with a perl regular expression
# to search for it (with '-i' option for case-insensitive).  You can supply
# a quoted file pattern to search for ('*.c'), run just "cg" alone to
# recall the last search (since it's save to the $LOGFILE), and running
# with a list of files is allowable (though not recurive and pattern-matched
# like the quoted variation).
#
# Examples: "cg printf", "cg printf '*.c'", "cg -i printf '*.c'",
#		"cg -i printf *.c", "cg", etc.
#
# The point of this script was to provide source code searching
# functionality similar to that AT&T's cscope(1).  This is a pure
# hack and lacks any sophistication, but has the advantage that it
# can be used for more than just the C programming language, besides
# adding the functionality that is generally missing from a developer's
# toolbox.
