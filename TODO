These are desired features for the future... if you want to do any of
these (since I'm busy at times and may not get to them for a while),
please email me at juziel@home.com ...

* Fix bugs involving using Perl's internal find... I don't think I'm
  using it completely correctly at the moment, and I'm sure some things
  need to be fixed about what I'm finding anyways.

* Perhaps expand the .cgvgrc file's ability to also specify a per-user
  default search path to use rather than all users having the same default.

* Possibly modify things so that Perl's internal grep is used rather
  than external "grep", "egrep" and "fgrep" and along with it have
  the program have it's own arguments rather than sending them to grep.
