These are desired features for the future... if you want to do any of
these (since I'm busy at times and may not get to them for a while),
please email me at juziel@home.com ...

* Optimization!  This program has to do a lot of searching, and any
  and all speed improvements need to be applied.

* Perhaps improve error checking on the .cgvgrc file

* Add options and arguments.  Currently, the only option beyond the
  search pattern and search list is '-i', or case insensitive.  Additional
  possible options need to be identified and implemented.

* See if the remaining hard-coded applications (currently "stty" and "which")
  can be made into straight perl without requiring a plugin from CPAN.

Feel free to contact me about improving these scripts.
