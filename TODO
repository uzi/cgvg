These are desired features for the future... if you want to do any of
these (since I'm busy at times and may not get to them for a while),
please email me at uzi@uzix.org ...

* Optimization!  This program has to do a lot of searching, and any
  and all speed improvements need to be applied.

* Perhaps improve error checking on the .cgvgrc file

* Add options and arguments.  Currently, the only options beyond the
  search pattern and search list is '-i', or case insensitive, 
  '-l' for the "last log" and the pager options '-p' and -P'. Additional
  possible options need to be identified and implemented.

* One such option (which goes with an idea) is to fix translating
  filespec processing, and to also have a -r "Perl RegExp pass-through"
  option to bypass it and use Perl RegExps.

* See if the remaining hard-coded applications (currently "stty" and "which")
  can be made into straight perl without requiring a plugin from CPAN.

* Clean up the code a bit more.  This will help out for the next point
  which is...

* Implement a GUI.  I have my ideas about how this should be.  Talk to
  me if you have any desire to work on this.

Feel free to contact me about improving these scripts.
