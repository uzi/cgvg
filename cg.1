.SH NAME
cg \- Recursively grep for a pattern and store it.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cg 
[ -l ] | [ [ -i ] pattern [ files ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "cg "
does a search though text files (usually source code) recursively
for a pattern, storing matches and displaying the output in a
human-readable fashion.  It is intended to give some of the
functionaly of AT&T's cscope(1) tool, with the advantages of
simplicity and not being language-specific.  The script will
colorize output if configured as such.
.sp
It is typically run with a Perl regular expression to search for.
The search can be made case insensitive by using the
.B -i
option.  A list of files may also be specified with an additional
argument after the pattern.  Put the files pattern in quotes to
make it be matched by Perl rather than by the shell.  Running the
script with no arguments will recall the results of the previous
search.  After the search, entries found can be edited using the
vg(1) script.  The
.B -l
option shows the last log made.
.PP
.SH "SOME EXAMPLES"
.B cg
- alone recalls the previous search results.
.sp
.B cg \-i pattern
- search the default list of files for all files matching the pattern
(and case-insensitively).
.sp
.B cg pattern '*.c'
- search recursively for pattern in all *.c files.  This automatically
converts '*' to '.*' and '.' to '\\.' for you and does a Perl pattern
match on all files in the tree.
.sp
.B cg pattern *.c
- search through the shell-expanded list of *.c files, so not done
recursively (in other words, only the files your shell pass to the
script as arguments).
.sp
.B cg \-l
- show the last log made.
.PP
.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"
.TP 0.5i

Do a case-insensitive search.
.TP 0.5i
.B "\-l "
Show the last log made.
.TP 0.5i

.TP 0.5i

Force the built-in pager to be disabled.
