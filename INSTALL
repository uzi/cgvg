cgvg Installation Instructions
==============================

Installation is quick and painless... edit the Makefile and set
the appropriate path to a Perl 5 interpreter with the "PERL"
variable, and the proper "PREFIX" for the path where you'd like
to install it.

Type "make" to generate the "cg" and "vg" executables.  Type
"make install" to copy the files to the appropriate places, or
copy them by hand.
