cgvg Installation Instructions
==============================

Installation is quick and painless...

./configure
make install

(A "make" isn't really needed.)  An possible option you might
want to use to configure is --prefix= to configure where it
goes instead of the default... so "./configure --prefix=/usr"
to make sure it goes into directories under /usr, etc.

If you want to modify per-user options, copy the cgvgrc-example
file into your home directory as .cgvgrc ... have fun! :)
