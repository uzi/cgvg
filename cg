# Recursive Grep script that does a bit of extra work in adding a count
# field and storing the data in a file.  Run as if you were running
# grep(1) normally, with only what to search for (and use the default
# search path), or no arguments to recall last search.
# Examples: "cg main", "cg", "cg -r main *.c", "cg -i main *.c", etc.
#
# The point of this script was to provide source code searching
# functionality similar to that AT&T's cscope(1).  This is a pure
# hack and lacks any sophistication, but has the advantage that it
# can be used for more than just the C programming language, besides
# adding the functionality that is generally missing from a developer's
# toolbox.
